# PrioritizeYourLifeWebsite

A website to set priorities and goals for your life (made for New Year's resolutions 2016)

### Description

The idea behind this website is to help prioritize your life goals (duh). The way it's organized is to first 
create the priorities for your life. Then make goals under each priority that will help you to pursue 
your priorities. Then make smaller milestones that can be met in less than a month. Then update the 
milestones as progress is made. Once a milestone is achieved it can be marked as complete. Once all milestones are completed and 
you have satisfied your goal you can mark the goal as accomplished.
